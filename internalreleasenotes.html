              Time for your biweekly dose of Product and Engineering awesome-ness! Scroll to whatever section you want
              updates about - there‚Äôs a little bit of flavor for every type of information-consumer that‚Äôs out there

            <ul>

              <li>Information about smaller, but noteworthy changes (bigger changes get their own release notes!)

              Card view Release and other highlights
            </h2>


            <p>
              Platform team has created an updated card view which is being piloted with USC and will be rolled out to
              client sites over the next 3 months. The new card view is functionally similar but includes significantly
              more user personalization options like moving tabs around, changing the panel width, moving fields around,
              and more! A release video will be going to clients, as well as a banner. An updated user guide will also
              be available.
            </p>
            <p>
              As part of this release, we are also doing formal external release notes to highlight the previous 2
              changes below for users, including the search update for folders, action panel change, and more. This
              would have already been available in client domains, but we wanted to ensure they were highlighted for
              clients fully and also update the user guides. Other changes such as the EOB lookup update are also
              highlighted in the external release notes.
            </p>

              (Previously Released) Search works on folders
            </h2>


            <p>
              VisiQuate enabled the ability for the search function to work with folders and subfolders. For users that
              may not recall a particular report name they want, or they just need to view items in a folder quickly,
              the user can now use search and folder names will show as well as the reports. We look forward to any
              feedback on this new capability and hope everyone finds it useful!

              (Previously Released) Action Panel Can Stay Open
            </h2>


            <p>
              VisiQuate enabled the ability for the action panel to stay open while selecting different records in the
              grid view. This will help users reduce clicks because they don‚Äôt need to reopen the panel when they select
              a new record. The user will be prompted to define if they want to stay on the record or change to the new
              record, if they have made changes to any of the fields. (this should be similar to how other websites
              work).

              (Previously released) DMA and ‚ÄúPayer‚Äù Flo Updates
            </h2>


            <p>
              VisiQuate has made exciting improvements to the content available in our Flo and DMA products, which all
              clients are welcome to take advantage of using their standard support hours. These enhancements are
              focused on improving user efficiency and accelerating cash Flow for the claims follow-up process.
              Publishing of these is in-flight and a more detailed document for clients will be available shortly.
            </p>
            <ul>

              <li>Common Changes
                <ul>

                  <li>New EOB Lookup table - Our team has updated the EOB lookup table to utilize both CARC and RARC
                    codes to drive denial sub-type and a new opportunity rank field (replaces the less accurate
                    opportunity %). Special thanks to Summer and Max for their analysis and providing the bulk of this
                    content

                  <li>All standard codes (revenue, CPT/HCPCs, CARC, RARC) were updated to the latest standards

                  <li>Standard fields were added for low dollar, low opportunity, and RARC hierarchy. Logic was updated
                    for high dollar flags, payment variance (previously underpaid) amounts and flags.

                  <li>Additional logic was embedded within the CARC Hierarchy lookup so it includes RARC as well as
                    denial opportunity and complexity, in addition to dollar amount
                  </li>
                </ul>

              <li>Flo-Specific changes
                <ul>

                  <li>Recommendation engine data is available in the SSDs and once sites have updated to use the new EOB
                    lookup they should also consider enabling recommendations for end users.

                  <li>Updated segmentation logic - VisiQuate updated our standard segmentation options to drive users
                    towards accounts that are most at-risk or that have the greatest impact on reducing A/R and
                    improving cash. This includes revamping the use of high-dollar, and adding black hole segments.
                  </li>

                  </th>
                  <th>Problem: action panels are essentially islands of custom code defined on a per-Flo basis. This
                    makes
                    it difficult to push new features to action panels. It also results in large volumes of
                    customization
                    tickets - both bugs and improvements.
                    <p>
                      Solution: This problem will need to be solved through several projects, but the most important one
                      is creating a standard ‚Äúlanguage‚Äù in how action panels are coded. This will reduce variability in
                      how the same kind of code is written and centralize artifact management for action panels across
                      Flos. This sets us up for eventually being able to configure action panels through the user
                      interface.

                    collections
                    lifecycle is unintelligent and not optimized. Moreover, as different events occur in an account‚Äôs
                    life
                    during this phase, this data is not really used to reprioritize what is worked on. The principles on
                    which PayFlo worklist segmentation is based attempt to address this, but they are limited by the
                    human
                    imagination of the SMEs that created PayFlo‚Äôs prioritization logic.
                    <p>
                      Solution: The mission of this feature is to reduce the volume of human intervention in deciding
                      how
                      work should be prioritized with the presumption that a machine can do it better. We also believe
                      that truly leveraging Ana or ‚ÄúAI‚Äù in PayFlo will become a major selling point for many Revenue

                      be involved in every decision on who should work on what and when.

                    account. This creates a knowledge gap for both managers and users because we are unable to

                    <p>
                      Solution: Flo will be moved from a ‚Äústatus/disposition‚Äù process where a user selects one each of
                      those items to a true business process Flow capability. Recommendations will be incorporated so
                      that
                      users select which ones they followed and can add others themselves. A process/state/sub-state

                    and
                    one for holds and edits. One common point between them is that users in both cases tend to focus on
                    the visit/encounter, not the claim, and in both cases work has to transition smoothly to the Payer
                    (claim) Flow.

                      Solution: Enable Flos and Analytics to be created that support these workFlows so that users can
                      easily track what needs to be done, and enable the transition of work across Flows seamlessly for
                      users so that rebilling can be done easily if needed.

                    and

                    PROD,

                    <p>

                      organization/separation of concerns/etc. It will also make it easier to build new features in, fix
                      bugs on and generally make it less prone to breaking as browsers evolve.

                      Solution:
                    <p>
                      - Provide UI/UX for seeing which rules overlap with which rules and by which volumes.
                    <p>
                      - Allow users to easily step into a rule and modify it to remove conflict, if desired
                    <p>
                      - Allow users to see how distributions change as users manage a conflict
                    <p>
                      - Allow users to maintain unique priority amongst rules

                    of Flo. This means Client Engineering needs to do the work, which makes configuration management
                    difficult and takes time (since that is managed through our JIRA/sprint process) - especially with
                    health system employees constantly coming/going.
                    <p>
                      Solution: allow Flo admin users to fully provision users of Flo through the Concerto interface and
                      manage hierarchy relationships between users/groups/etc.

                    product managers better understand who is using what parts of our application. This information
                    exists
                    in a variety of repositories, but we lack a comprehensive user experience that enables our VisiQuate
                    team members to quickly get insights across a variety of usage subjects. Instead, technical
                    resources
                    are required to extract data out of repositories like platform MySQL databases, Elastic Search
                    (Kibana), etc. While we do offer account managers the ability to analyze data from Kibana as a
                    dataset
                    exposed to our Paradise, most newer or infrequent users of usage reporting are unclear on how to use
                    the dataset. Moreover, team members have produced tons of content with different views of "truth"
                    due
                    to misuse of filtering logic, etc.
                    <p>
                      Solution: VisiQuate needs to "VisiQuate" VisiQuate product usage analytics. We need a
                      comprehensive
                      analytics suite that enables us to assess product usage for all major features. We also need more
                      standardized ways of reviewing where users are spending most of their time in analytics to get a
                      better sense of where our clients find value in our reporting and workFlow suite. In several
                      years,
                      we will have grown this analytics suite into an even more comprehensive analytics toolkit for
                      reviewing usage patterns, drop-off points and other consumer application-style metrics. This North
                      Star will require technology upgrades along the way. We can get started, though, by leveraging the
                      existing BI stack that we have and building data pipelines into this usage analytics ecosystem.

                    <p>
                      Solution: Creating some basic test automation for all our elements as it relates to the base

                      reserves
                      for a month at any point) plus supporting documentation reports. Create a standard SSD that can be
                      used, and also enable a hindsight report as part of the supporting documentation.

                    underlying methodologies and frameworks for enabling WPA's value proposition need strengthening so
                    that we can use WPA as a jumping off point for assessing organizational impact of an individual
                    worker.
                    <p>
                      Solution: Update WPA into a new solution package that is sufficiently different from RMA/DMA to
                      justify it as a separate product. The emphasis will be on applying kai-zen/Kanban methodologies to
                      the revenue cycle in order to create an apples-to-apples framework for measuring worker
                      performance.
                      Using tried/true management principles for how to manage teams that fundamentally work backlogs to
                      produce added value on a claim assembly line will provide a robust knowledge framework that will
                      make Revenue Cycle leaders feel like they are adopting a best-in-breed approach. Also, this will
                      enable future initiatives to conduct process mining and assessing impact of workers on revenue
