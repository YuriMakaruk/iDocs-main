              VisiQuate enabled the ability for the search function to work with folders and subfolders. For users that may not recall a particular report name they want, or they just need to view items in a folder quickly, the user can now use
              search and folder names will show as well as the reports. We look forward to any feedback on this new capability and hope everyone finds it useful!

              VisiQuate enabled the ability for the action panel to stay open while selecting different records in the grid view. This will help users reduce clicks because they don‚Äôt need to reopen the panel when they select a new record. The user
              will be prompted to define if they want to stay on the record or change to the new record, if they have made changes to any of the fields. (this should be similar to how other websites work).

              (Previously released) DMA and ‚ÄúPayer‚Äù Flo Updates
            </h2>

            <p>
              VisiQuate has made exciting improvements to the content available in our Flo and DMA products, which all clients are welcome to take advantage of using their standard support hours. These enhancements are focused on improving user
              efficiency and accelerating cash flow for the claims follow-up process. Publishing of these is in-flight and a more detailed document for clients will be available shortly.
            </p>
            <ul>

              <li>Common Changes
                <ul>

                  <li>New EOB Lookup table - Our team has updated the EOB lookup table to utilize both CARC and RARC codes to drive denial sub-type and a new opportunity rank field (replaces the less accurate opportunity %). Special thanks to Summer
                    and Max for their analysis and providing the bulk of this content

                  <li>All standard codes (revenue, CPT/HCPCs, CARC, RARC) were updated to the latest standards

                  <li>Standard fields were added for low dollar, low opportunity, and RARC hierarchy. Logic was updated for high dollar flags, payment variance (previously underpaid) amounts and flags.

                  <li>Additional logic was embedded within the CARC Hierarchy lookup so it includes RARC as well as denial opportunity and complexity, in addition to dollar amount
                  </li>
                </ul>

              <li>Flo-Specific changes
                <ul>

                  <li>Recommendation engine data is available in the SSDs and once sites have updated to use the new EOB lookup they should also consider enabling recommendations for end users.

                  <li>Updated segmentation logic - VisiQuate updated our standard segmentation options to drive users towards accounts that are most at-risk or that have the greatest impact on reducing A/R and improving cash. This includes revamping
                    the use of high-dollar, and adding black hole segments.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                </td>
                <td>Problem: action panels are essentially islands of custom code defined on a per-Flo basis. This makes it difficult to push new features to action panels. It also results in large volumes of customization tickets - both bugs and
                  improvements.
                  <p>
                    Solution: This problem will need to be solved through several projects, but the most important one is creating a standard ‚Äúlanguage‚Äù in how action panels are coded. This will reduce variability in how the same kind of code is
                    written and centralize artifact management for action panels across Flos. This sets us up for eventually being able to configure action panels through the user interface.

                <td>Problem: Revenue Cycle leaders know that the current way of distributing work during the collections lifecycle is unintelligent and not optimized. Moreover, as different events occur in an account‚Äôs life during this phase, this
                  data is not really used to reprioritize what is worked on. The principles on which PayFlo worklist segmentation is based attempt to address this, but they are limited by the human imagination of the SMEs that created PayFlo‚Äôs
                  prioritization logic.
                  <p>
                    Solution: The mission of this feature is to reduce the volume of human intervention in deciding how work should be prioritized with the presumption that a machine can do it better. We also believe that truly leveraging Ana or ‚ÄúAI‚Äù
                    in PayFlo will become a major selling point for many Revenue Cycle leaders because of the promise of continuous improvement of a machine‚Äôs prioritization/segmentation engine compared to a suite of static business logic rules.
                    Looking to the future, a machine should be involved in every decision on who should work on what and when.

                </td>
                <td>Problem: Within the Flo process today, there is not a good way to track the detailed status of any given item, and also track the detailed actions that may be done by a user when they ‚Äútouch‚Äù an account. This creates a knowledge
                  gap for both managers and users because we are unable to efficiently measure the details of what happens during a ‚Äútouch‚Äù
                  <p>
                    Solution: Flo will be moved from a ‚Äústatus/disposition‚Äù process where a user selects one each of those items to a true business process flow capability. Recommendations will be incorporated so that users select which ones they
                    followed and can add others themselves. A process/state/sub-state will be implemented so that there is a more accurate view of where the current work item stands on it‚Äôs road to completion. These 2 things together will allow us to
                    better provide process analytics for clients and improve recommendations which would reduce cost and improve yield.

                  <p>
                    Solution: Create a standardized set of analytics with the VQ8 process (summarize, trend, benchmark, explore anomaly) that can be used with daily files about appointments and registration information to help the clients manage
                    their patient access process.

                <td>Problem: Clients need to manage the ‚Äúmid-cycle‚Äù - that time between (or during) the clinical work for the patient and billing. There are at least 2 identified workflows, one for utilization review and one for holds and edits. One
                  common point between them is that users in both cases tend to focus on the visit/encounter, not the claim, and in both cases work has to transition smoothly to the Payer (claim) flow.
                  <p>
                    Solution: Enable Flos and Analytics to be created that support these workflows so that users can easily track what needs to be done, and enable the transition of work across flows seamlessly for users so that rebilling can be done
                    easily if needed.

                  valuation, the sites need some way to get expected reimbursement
                  <p>
                    Solution: VisiQuate can provide integration with a 3rd party Contract Management system via a partner called Parathon. We will enable reusable integration with Parathon which can push in expected reimbursement based on claims and
                    other data which we pass from the client database to Parathon.

                  leveraging ADC products.
                  <p>
                    Solution: set-up an eCommerce portal accessible through the platform to create a unified experience for HCPs from a single ADC portal (analytics, eCommerce, etc.). As much as possible, leverage COTS tools to make it easy for ADC
                    to administer the platform on their own, long-term.

                  continuing to comply with promises made.
                  <p>
                    Solution: Payer Action Center seeks to provide revenue cycle leaders and contract negotiators a single interface for managing relationships with payers. This is done by providing a continuous stream of new monitoring ‚Äúrules‚Äù
                    illuminating payer misbehavior by VQ8 SMEs; also by a means of creating escalation lists and then tracking payer remediation and long-term behavioral changes; finally- quick benchmarking on key statistics to compare like payers
                    behavior.

                </td>
                <td>Problem: deploying Flo configurations is a manual, error-prone process. There is no single engine that manages all of the ways a Flo can be configured and each configuration setting. So, when deployments occur taking something
                  that was developed on an internal environment and put out on PROD, bugs can be introduced because the process is done manually by an engineer or because dependencies are not properly managed in configured components.
                  <p>
                    Solution: create a configuration framework that uniquely identifies all configuration settings. This will make it easier to perform updates to a given Flo and reduce the risk of errors being introduced in the deployment process.

                </td>
                <td>Problem: card view is part of legacy Concerto architecture and as such, is difficult to maintain when bugs arise or any kind of new feature development (such as activity stream) occurs. Moreover, it still uses an older version of
                  Angular that could eventually pose a security risk and again, makes it difficult to maintain and keep compatible with modern browsers.
                  <p>
                    <br>Solution: we need to add Card View to the Aurora infrastructure we built for our front-end user interface. This will make it much easier to maintain since it will follow similar code organization/separation of concerns/etc. It
                    will also make it easier to build new features in, fix bugs on and generally make it less prone to breaking as browsers evolve.

                  <p>
                    - Provide UI/UX for seeing which rules overlap with which rules and by which volumes.
                  <p>

                    - Allow users to see how distributions change as users manage a conflict
                  <p>

                <td>Problem: setting up users to have access to Flo, reporting levels, etc. is all done on the backend of Flo. This means Client Engineering needs to do the work, which makes configuration management difficult and takes time (since
                  that is managed through our JIRA/sprint process) - especially with health system employees constantly coming/going.
                  <p>
                    Solution: allow Flo admin users to fully provision users of Flo through the Concerto interface and manage hierarchy relationships between users/groups/etc.

                </td>
                <td>Problem: VisiQuate needs a comprehensive product usage analytics system that can help account and product managers better understand who is using what parts of our application. This information exists in a variety of repositories,
                  but we lack a comprehensive user experience that enables our VisiQuate team members to quickly get insights across a variety of usage subjects. Instead, technical resources are required to extract data out of repositories like
                  platform MySQL databases, Elastic Search (Kibana), etc. While we do offer account managers the ability to analyze data from Kibana as a dataset exposed to our Paradise, most newer or infrequent users of usage reporting are unclear
                  on how to use the dataset. Moreover, team members have produced tons of content with different views of "truth" due to misuse of filtering logic, etc.
                  <p>
                    Solution: VisiQuate needs to "VisiQuate" VisiQuate product usage analytics. We need a comprehensive analytics suite that enables us to assess product usage for all major features. We also need more standardized ways of reviewing
                    where users are spending most of their time in analytics to get a better sense of where our clients find value in our reporting and workflow suite. In several years, we will have grown this analytics suite into an even more
                    comprehensive analytics toolkit for reviewing usage patterns, drop-off points and other consumer application-style metrics. This North Star will require technology upgrades along the way. We can get started, though, by leveraging
                    the existing BI stack that we have and building data pipelines into this usage analytics ecosystem.

                  <p>
                    Solution: Creating some basic test automation for all our elements as it relates to the base platform will ensure QA can focus on more complex use cases and we can potentially catch more issues before a client sees them or before
                    they impact clients.

                  <p>
                    Solution: Update WPA into a new solution package that is sufficiently different from RMA/DMA to justify it as a separate product. The emphasis will be on applying kai-zen/Kanban methodologies to the revenue cycle in order to
                    create an apples-to-apples framework for measuring worker performance. Using tried/true management principles for how to manage teams that fundamentally work backlogs to produce added value on a claim assembly line will provide a
                    robust knowledge framework that will make Revenue Cycle leaders feel like they are adopting a best-in-breed approach. Also, this will enable future initiatives to conduct process mining and assessing impact of workers on revenue
                    cycle KPIs.
